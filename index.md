## About Me

Hi, I'm Bonnie, a student interested in word games and computer programming.  
This project was part of my final quest in my computer programming class, and it reflects what I’ve learned about designing and building simple games.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *Hangman*  
**Genre/Type:** Game  
**One-line pitch:** A word game where you try to guess the word in as few letters as possible!
