### What I Set Out to Do

My goal is to work on improving some of my functions, specifically my print_word_progress() function and my final hangman() function. I noticed that my print_word_progress() function does not keep track of the letters that have already been guessed correctly when it displays new letters that have been correctly guessed in the chosen word. This is an issue because it makes it more difficult for the user to keep track of which letters were correctly guessed and where they are positioned in the word. Additionally, my hangman() function needs to be improved because it does not currently have a way of checking whether the game has been won or lost.

### What I Actually Did

I started with tackling my print_word_progress() function. This ended up being more challenging for me than I thought it would be, so I spent most of my time trying to figure out how to fix the function so it would work the way I wanted it to. 

Here's what I originally had:

In this version of my code, the correctly guessed letters would print in the correct places, but when I ran my hangman() function, it would not keep track of the letters that had already been revealed. 

I was able to improve my code by recognizing that nothing was being returned in print_word_progress(), so there was nothing to run back through the function and "add" to. After realizing this, I decided to make the function accept another argument, current_word. I also made it so that print_word_progress would return current_word. I also realized that all the words I am working with have a length of 5, so I can use "in range(5)" instead of "for letter in word." Here's what my new code looks like:

I recognize that this introduces a few new problems. I need to go through my hangman() function and pass a new argument, current_word, to print_word_progress(). This will be a task I tackle later on in the week.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I noticed that in a lot of my original functions, I did a lot of printing instead of returning. I realized that it's helpful to actually return things in your function because then you can use that information later! My big takeaway is: remember that you can make a variable an argument, and you can return it. This way you can pass what you just returned back through your function in order to modify or update it.

### What's Next

Over the next few days, I want to continue fixing some of the problems I had identified earlier (like the hangman() checks), as well as some of the new problems that arose (like introducing the new current_word argument in the hangman() function).
