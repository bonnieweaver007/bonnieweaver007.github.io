### What I Set Out to Do

At this stage in my project, I'm aiming to adjust some of my code and fix some of my functions so that they perform the way I want them to. First, I want to initialize a list variable for the new argument (current_word) that I created for my print_word_progress() function. Given that print_word_progress now takes and returns a list containing the letters of the chosen word, I realize that I now need to create a new function that converts the final current_word output from a list to a string so that it can be printed and easily read by the viewer. 

---

### What I Actually Did

I was able to easily initialize the new list variable current_word inside of my hangman() function so that it could be passed back to my print_word_progress() function. I then began working on my new function, list_to_string(), which converts current_word from a list to a string. 

Here's the code for list_to_string():

Additionally, I fixed a small error in hangman() that caused my game to ask for user input once more after the user had lost the game. In order to fix it, I moved an index variable above an if statement that checked whether the index was equal to 7 (the index of the last element in a list of hangman depictions). 

Here's what the end of my hangman() function looks like now:

Lastly, I received feedback that it would be cool to replace the hangman depiction with the updated depiction, rather than print another depiction each time the user inputs a new letter. I did a little research, and I found two possible ways of doing this. The first is importing os and using os.system('cls'). However, I don't think Google Colab is set up in a way that allows this to work. The second potential way of clearing the output I found was using clear_output(wait = True). This essentially waits until there is an input before the previous output is cleared. I tried using clear_output() in hangman(), and it appeared to work at first. However, each time I ran the function, the user input box would eventually disappear and make it impossible for the game to continue.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that it's helpful to ask other people to test out my game because they sometimes provide feedback or ideas that I hadn't considered before. I hadn't thought about trying to replace the pictures instead of printing new ones until another person noted that it was a little inconvenient to scroll through the outputs.

### What's Next

In the next stage of my project, I want to continue looking into whether replacing the pictures would be feasible. Additionally, I may try to create another component of the game that keeps track of and prints all the letters that have already been guessed so that users can easily remember which letters they have or haven't guessed.
