### Project Focus

For my final project, I would like to create a game of Hangman. I plan on implementing a visual element so that the game feels more realistic and engaging for the user.

---

### Why This Project 

I love word games like the New York Times Connections and Spelling Bee, so I wanted to program a game that involves words and one that everyone knows. That led me to choose Hangman as the game I want to simulate.

---

### What I Want to Learn

Through this project, I want to strengthen my understanding of for loops, while loops, and conditional statements, as well as my understanding of how to build modular functions that will work together to create a fully functioning game. I also want to strengthen my ability to debug problems and organize my code so that problems won't occur when it's tested against edge cases.


### My Approach 

Over the next week, I plan to first focus on finishing the code for the text-based part of my Hangman game. After that, I will begin building graphics for the game, either by using strings and keyboard characters or by implementing a GUI. My game will be "done enough" when it doesn't have bugs, is fully functional, and has a visual element that represents a hangman gaining limbs.

### What's Next

So far, I've created a function that picks a random word, a function that prints instructions, and a function that checks whether a user's inputted letter is a) a valid character and b) in the word. My next step is to create a function that keeps looping until the entire word is guessed. After that, I will build a function that prints string visuals (and if I have time I will look into tkinter).
