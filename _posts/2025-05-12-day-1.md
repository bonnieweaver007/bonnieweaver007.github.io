title: "Day 1 - Considering Arguments and Returns"

### What I Set Out to Do
This week, I'm trying to figure out how to modularize and order my Hangman functions. In particular, I want to figure out what arguments, if any, my functions need to have and what each function should return. I think I will have to edit some of my docstrings because for a number of functions I created, I didn't originally call for any arguments. However, I think it will be helpful later on if I allow certain functions to have inputs. I also want to make sure that none of my functions are performing too many tasks and that I'm splitting up each task into easily reusable parts. Additionally, I'm trying to figure out is how to effectively call all the functions I've created in one bigger function. This function will be in control of calling all the functions necessary for the game to work realisitically.

### What I Actually Did

I ended up editing my functions so that they could all be called in a final function. I primarily focused on my letter_check() function and my hangman() function. I realized that the way I had set up my functions didn't make a lot of sense. I did not originally call for any arguments in letter_check(), and the function was supposed to both print a statement and return a boolean true or false depending on whether a user-inputted letter was in the word or not. However, I discovered that this function had a few issues. First, it didn't check for whether the inputted letter was in the alphabet, whether it had already been guessed, or whether it was a single letter. To fix this, I updated my function to include checks for these cases. Additionally, I realized that I was calling important functions and initializing variables in my letter_check() function, making it awkward to call them in my final hangman() function. In order to fix this, I made letter_check() accept arguments and called the important functions and variables (like word_pick() and guessed_word) in hangman(). I also made letter_check() return integer values 1-4 instead of just True or False.

Here's what my docstring for letter_check() looked like before the edits:

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that it's often more useful to call functions and initialize variables in a final function, not in a function that is a component part of the whole game. This way, I don't have to reintroduce the variables in each subsequent function, I can just make them arguments that my smaller functions take.

### What's Next

Over the next few days, I plan to tackle the visual elements of the project and make sure that they work properly. I also want to test my code and come up with assert statements to ensure that my functions are working as well.
