### What I Set Out to Do

My goal today was to tackle why clear_output() wasn't working and how I could fix it. After getting some more user feedback, I also wanted to print the letters that were already guessed so that it was easier to remember which ones you had guessed.

### What I Actually Did

The first thing I tackled was printing the letters that were already guessed but not in the word. I already had a set variable, incorrect_letters, that contained all the letters guessed that were not in the word, so I added a line of code that converted the set into a list and printed the letters (I converted it to a list because I thought it aesthetically looked better than a set). 

Next, I tried to figure out what wasn't working with clear_output(). I looked at the Level Up 3, Q6, and saw that clear_output() was positioned right after the while loop line. However, I had originally put my clear_output() after the user input. By putting it after the user input, I think I was sometimes clearing the user input in addition to everything else. By putting clear_output() before the user input, the user input will always be called after the display has been cleared.

Here's a picture of my updated clear_output() positioning:

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that sometimes when it comes to new concepts, it can be especially helpful to look at how that concept is used in other code. Before looking at the Wordle problem in Level Up 3, I wasn't quite sure where to move clear_output() so that it would work effectively. However, after observing how it was used in a different problem, it became a lot more clear how I should use it in my own code.

### What's Next

The next stage of my project is editing my functions and perhaps making new functions so that no one function is overly crowded or repetitive. I'll also consider some more user feedback!
