title: "Day 5 - Final Edits and Polishing"

### What I Set Out to Do

After presenting my project and code in class, I got some feedback on how to polish my code a little. The first was to implement a time delay to ensure that clear_output won't accidentally clear the input prompt if the person running the code has a faster processing speed. The next suggestion was to add type hints and simplify docstrings by getting rid of unnecessary "none" arguments and "none" returns.

### What I Actually Did

First, I implemented the time delay. I imported time, and then I inserted a line of code, time.sleep(.25), into my play_hangman() function (I also updated the name). This line of code delays the time it takes for the function to ask for user input by just a tiny amount. 

Here's a picture of the new line of code:

Next, I added type hints and cut the "none" arguments and "none" returns out of my docstrings. 

Although I didn't initially set out to change the file from which the words were coming, I was given a new file that had more "regular" English words (and of varying length, not just 5 letters long!). In order to use this file instead of the NYT Wordle words file, I saved the file, english-common-words.txt, and added it to the same location as the Wordle file. Because the words in the new file were of varying length, I made sure to go back through each of my functions and replace any assumptions of 5-letter words with the len(word). 

Here's my updated pick_word() function:

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned to be open-minded when new ideas or opportunities come my way. I also learned to try out new ideas because they are not always as hard as they may seem. I had thought a little bit about how the Wordle word list provided the user with weird words, but I hadn't really put too much thought into actually switching the file. However, when I was given the opportunity to, I realized that it wasn't as daunting as I thought it was. It only involved changing a few lines of code that I was already aware of.

### What's Next

My final step is to review my code once more and fix any small mistakes that I might find. After that, my Hangman game will be complete and ready to upload to GitHub!
